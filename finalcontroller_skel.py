# Final Skeleton
#
# Hints/Reminders from Lab 3:
#
# To check the source and destination of an IP packet, you can use
# the header information... For example:
#
# ip_header = packet.find('ipv4')
#
# if ip_header.srcip == "1.1.1.1":
#   print "Packet is from 1.1.1.1"
#
# Important Note: the "is" comparison DOES NOT work for IP address
# comparisons in this way. You must use ==.
# 
# To send an OpenFlow Message telling a switch to send packets out a
# port, do the following, replacing <PORT> with the port number the 
# switch should send the packets out:
#
#    msg = of.ofp_flow_mod()
#    msg.match = of.ofp_match.from_packet(packet)
#    msg.idle_timeout = 30
#    msg.hard_timeout = 30
#
#    msg.actions.append(of.ofp_action_output(port = <PORT>))
#    msg.data = packet_in
#    self.connection.send(msg)
#
# To drop packets, simply omit the action.
#
